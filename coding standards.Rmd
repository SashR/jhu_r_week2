## Week 2 
### Coding standards in R

1. Always use text files / text editor. It is ubiquitous
2. Indent your code. Improves readability.
3. Limit the width of your code (80 columns). Indenting can be adjusted in RStudio. Go to Preferences -> Code Editing -> tab width. Recommended indent of 8 and 80 column margin. Helps enforce other standards (i.e. not nesting too many loops / control structures)
4. Limit the length of individual functions. Makes them easier to read, reuse and debug. Error messages point to a function when an error occurs, if that function is 800 lines long there is a lot of code that might be an issue. Compare this if the function is 8 lines long.
